## Learning Objectives and Paths
Learning Objectives are statements that have the form: "I am a `part of audience`, and I want to know `a learning objective`." For example, "I am best described as a _practitioner_ and I want to _learn what a knowledge graph schema is_." Learning Paths are the sequence of modules that a learner would review in order to accomplish their learning objective.

Here are some example learning paths:
* [All Learning Paths](./learning_paths.md)
* "I am a practitioner and I want to learn what a knowledge graph schema is."
* "I am a beginner and I want to deploy a knowledge graph."
* "I am a graduate student and I need to survey different ontology engineering paradigms."
* "I am a project manager and I am exploring knowledge graph technologies, where do I start?"
* "I am a beginner, and I want to know what a taxonomy is."

## Qualities of Modules
The aim is for the KGC Open Curriculum to be: 

* **Scalable:** Follow a similar, integrated, and extensible pattern for each module 
* **Efficient:** Follow a well-thought-through design that won't waste anyone’s time
* **Minimalist:** Keep it simple
* **Strategic:** Focus on the 20% of the subject that is used 80% of the time
* **Not serious:** Be friendly, conversational, self-deprecating, and “you” focused
* **Coherent:** Integrate modules with clear links mapped to associated domains
* **Graph-ic:** Use knowledge graphs to illustrate how topics relate within a module
* **Practical:** Help practitioners put theory into practice
* **Executable:** Equip participants to develop semantic models using executable syntax
* **Authoritative:** Reference expert sources like those featured in the KGC Book Club
