New Preliminary Question List

- What is a “knowledge graph”?

  - Give me a straightforward high concept that doesn’t trip over itself.
    - How is it different from “linked data” or “the semantic web”?
- What is a KG used for?

  - Why should I choose a KG over some other kind of technology?
    - If they’re so great, why haven’t they taken over the world?
- Why is the subject so 🤬 complicated?

  - Why hasn’t anyone produced an educational starting point that isn’t mired in academic or technical jargon?
    - Why is there no single, at least *semi*-canonical source of education about the subject?

  - Why do people insist on muddying the subject with new variations, extensions to the basics (SHACL, entity extraction, machine learning)?
- Education
- [Add who, what, how designations for the learning paths]
- What are the necessary prerequisites to learning about KG, and at what levels?
  - Computer science?
  - Math?
  - Logic?

- What is the most basic starting point for learning KG?
- What is the absolute minimum I need to know about OWL?\
- What is the next-to-absolute minimum I need to know about OWL?
- How can I learn this subject, really learn it, by building understanding and memory through repetition?
- Implementation

  - Tell me how to design, build, and query a knowledge graph in a freshman learning session using readily available technology. Go.
     - Tell me how to reach the next level (whatever that is) of education in a sophomore learning session. Go.


## Original Questions from Group Discussion

In progress and not in final order:

* What is the minimum "stack" (software and standards) that I could use to design, add data to, and query a linked data model?
* What does RDFS (RDF Schema) add to RDF (the Resource Description Format)? Why would I use it in my ontology?
* At what point in an ontology design does a class turn into a resource? That is, how do you know that you're referring not to a group of things but to a specific thing?
* Is there a single "right" combination of properties, classes, and resources to describe what you're modeling, or can there be many different ways of describing a collection?
* I'm frightened by the apparent complexity of OWL (the Web Ontology Language). What problems or challenges does it solve?
* What is the difference between an RDFS class and an OWL class?
* Many of the OWL-related references in particular seem to refer to logic. How much logic do I really need to know to design and use ontologies?
* Can you give me an example of inference in action? Is it primarily used by ontology tools to check logic or can it be invoked using triple stores?
* How can the same values or URIs be used both subjects and objects in triples? Aren't they either one thing or the other?
* What is the difference between a URL, URI, and URN?
* What is this hash vs. slash business?
   * How do I point to an RDF file in a URI without using an extension like “.rdf”?
   * What does it take to redirect browsers to different formats of my data?
* If anyone can say anything about anything (the semantic web AAA slogan), how can I trust the results of combined data sources?
* What is the difference between an RDF triple store and a property graph? Why would someone choose to use one over the other?
* SPARQL:
   * What is SPARQL?
   * What are the basics of using SPARQL to query a graph database?
   * How is SPARQL similar to and different from SQL (the Structured Query Language)?
   * How do I filter on partial strings when I'm writing a SPARQL query?
   * How do I find SPARQL endpoints and connect to them in my queries? Is it better to download the RDF files and import them into my own triple store?
* Do I need to add entity or language tags like “@en” to my values in RDF?
* Why should I create my data in RDF? Isn't it just easier to import worksheet data into a knowledge graph application?
* What is the difference between the various serialization formats? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each? Which is the best for beginners?
* What is a "graph" within the context of an RDF file? Why would I need one and how would I create in RDF?
* What is "dereferencing"? Can you show us an example of it in the wild?
* Reification:
   * What is reification?
   * Why is reification important?
   * How would I implement reification in different graph systems?
* Schema.org:
   * What is Schema.org?
   * How do I navigate Schema.org’s user interface?
   * How do I embed properties and classes from Schema.org into my own ontology?
