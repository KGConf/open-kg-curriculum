### What are *properties* in triples or knowledge graphs? 

Triples are defined in the Resource Definition Framework (RDF) developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and introduced in the Open Curriculum’s [RDF Module](../RDF/RDF.md). Triples, the fundamental data structure of RDF, are made up of a subject, predicate, and object. [1] 

    subject    predicate    object

The *predicate* expresses how the subject is *related* to the object. Here are some sample definitions of knowledge graphs. Notice how relationships (italics ours) are integral to these definitions. 

>"[Google] has been working on an intelligent model—in geek-speak, a “graph”—that understands real-world entities and their *relationships* to one another: things, not strings." [2]

>“Knowledge graphs are large networks of entities, their semantic types, *properties*, and *relationships* between entities” [3]. 

>“A knowledge graph (i) mainly describes real-world entities and their *interrelations*, organized in a graph, (ii) defines possible classes and *relations* of entities in a schema, (iii) allows for potentially *interrelating* arbitrary entities with each other, and (iv) covers various topical domains.” [4]

The RDF term for predicate is *property*. Predicate and property refer to the same concept and are often used interchangeably. [5, 6] 

### Why are properties like arrows? ### 
In RDF triples, the predicate states the nature of the relationship between the subject and the object in a *directional* way, i.e., from subject to object. This enables modeling of asymetrical relationships, such as hierarchy, influence, dependency, and causation.

A Knowledge Graph Conference has subevents, including sessions, which are on broad topics called tracks: e.g., ontologies, taxonomies, and data modeling. 


### What other terms are used for properties?  ###
There are many different contributors to the knowledge graph community. Properties are sometimes called *edges* (a term borrowed from solid geometry) or *arcs* (drawn from knowledge graph theory). Properties are similar to the *labeled link lines* of concept maps and *associations* used in creating topic maps. Properties are conceptually related to *relations* (knowledge graph embedding), *roles*, and *associations* (description logics).  

### Edges and arcs: Solid geometry and graph theory
| Methodology | Subject | Predicate | Object|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solid Geometry | vertex | edge | vertex|
| Graph Theory | nodes  | arcs  | nodes|

In solid geometry, a *vertex* is the meeting point of two or more edges of a solid shape. An *edge* connects two vertices (the plural of vertex), defining how they are related spatially. Like a predicate, an edge connects two elements; so, edge is often used interchangably with predicate and property.

Graph theory uses different terms, describing networks in terms of *nodes* and *arcs*. Since graphs are directional, the subject has an *outgoing* edge (or arc), the object has an *incoming* edge. With this terminology you can decode these definitions: 

>"A graph is a collection of *vertices* interconnected by *edges*" [7]

>"An object is a *node* in a linked data graph with at least one incoming *edge*." [8] 

>"*RDF Graph*: A labeled *directed* graph, i.e., a set of nodes connected by *directed-arcs*. [8]

### Description Logics and Knowledge Graph Embedding  ###

| Methodology | Subject | Predicate | Object|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description Logics | concept or instance | roles (object properties) or attributes (data properties) | concept or instance |
| Knowledge Graph Embedding (Fact) | tail (t) | relation (r) | head (h)  |



### Mind, concept, and topic maps ##
| Methodology | Subject | Predicate | Object|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mind maps. Concept maps.  | nodes (box, circle, diamond, etc.)  | labeled link lines, arrows | nodes |
| Topic map (for indexes) | topics| associations | occurrences |


## Can I specify the type of subject and object that a property has?  ##
| Methodology | Subject | Predicate | Object|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RDFS and OWL | domain | object or data properties | range|

In RDF, the *domain* is the set of resources that can serve as the subject of a certain property; likewise, the *range* is the set of resources that can serve as the object of that property. What is the benefit of specifying the domain and range of a property? It adds semantic contraints by specifying the class typically associated with a property.
