### What do we mean when we say “class” in natural language? 

This is a class, a tutorial, about subclasses; but, you can’t talk about subclasses without talking about classes. So it’s really a Class and Subclass Class. 

The word “class” can be used in different ways: it could be a course of instruction, a social rank, or the quality of someone elegant – “Tony Bennett has a lot of class.” But you probably aren’t concerned here about your social rank (although it will, no doubt, rise as a result of this class). You inherently have an attribute of panache; so, perhaps this is the Classy Class and Subclass Class.  

### What is a “class” in the context of modeling knowledge, crunching data, or defining terms?  

Webster's dictionary has an entry under “class” that is close to how it is used in semantics: “a group, set, or kind sharing common attributes” [1].  Another definition for class emphasizes the same thing: “A group, collection, category or set sharing characteristics or attributes” [2]. 

Note that a members of a class, group, kind, category, or set share a common attribute or characteristic. A class member must have an attribute or some characteristics in common – a common denominator or trait – with other members. If they don't have something in common, they aren't the same kind of thing. In his book, *Demystifying OWL for the Enterprise*, Michael Uschold's says a class represents "kinds of things" [3]. 

### What is an attribute in natural language? 
OxfordLanguages defines the word "attribute" as “a quality or feature regarded as a characteristic or inherent part of someone or something” [4]. Webster's dictionary defines "attribute" as: “a quality, character, or characteristic ascribed to someone or something.”
Webster defines "characteristics" as: “a distinguishing trait, quality, or property.” To summarize, you can define an attribute as a quality, feature, characteristic, or trait ascribed to someone or something. 

Are attributes arbitrary and subjective? Or, are they qualities inherent in the nature of people or objects? Are they something we discover rather than ascribe? There is a debate whether attributes are qualities in things or constructs of the mind, which runs into the deeper sea of philosophy, psychology, and logic. We’ll stay near the shore for now and admit it takes some thought to identify attributes in things.   

This is a class about the semantic web. Semantics is a discipline of linguistics focused on meaning. In semantics, certain attributes are defined as “distinctive features”: an attribute or set of attributes unique to the class or individual. When defining words, you look for distinctive features. So identifying unique attributes or sets of attributes is important in defining classes, as well. 

### What is a subclass?

Sets can have subsets, groups can have subgroups, and categories can have subcategories; so, classes can have subclasses. The higher-level class is often called the “parent” class. Sometimes the parent class is called the superclass or base class. The lower-level subclass is called the “child” class. 

As Michael Uschold has said, a class represents "kinds of things." Subclasses are necessary because, "There are more specific and more general kinds of things" [5]. A subclass is more specific because a class may contain multiple subclasses, each with it's own distinctive features. Every member of a subclass shares a more-specific attribute or set of attributes than the larger class.

We have seen that classes may contain subclasses: What else could they contain?

### What is an individual? 

An individual can be a member of a class or subclass. The word "individual" happens to be a very popular word: Webster's says it's in the top 1% [6]. But what is it? Defining "individual", Webster's uses phrases like, "a particular being or thing," "an indivisible entity," or "a single organism. It is single, particular, and indivisible as distinguished from a group, class, or species. The important idea is the an individual is undivided, a single element, an instance. 

Michael Uschold adds the term "individual" to his natural language definitions of class and subclass:  
* Class: There are "kinds of things" or "general kinds of things" 
* Subclass: There are "more specific kinds of things" 
* Individual: There are "individual things." "An individual is an instance of a certain kind of thing" [7]

If an individual is a member of a subclass, then that individual instance is also a member of the parent class. The individual member of a subclass inherits attributes from the parent class. This simple statement opens up the topic of inferences which are explored in detail in [Introduction to Logic](../../Introduction_to_Logic.md), [Introduction to Set Theory](../../Introduction_to_Set_Theory.md), and [OWL](../../OWL.md).  

### Why classify things? 

Classification is the act of forming classes and subclasses by identifying common attributes. We classify things to impose order, to find hidden relationships, to make things simpler, to help us find things. We classify to organize socks in a drawer, books in a library, groceries in the store, concepts in our mind. 

The amount of available data, text, video, and programming in digital form has skyrocketed. So, how do you find things? How do you organize things? How do you interpret the data and identify patterns? Often, there is a separate repository of data for every application built, which multiplies silos. So, learning about classes and subclasses can be one of the first steps to organizing data, breaking down siloes, and helping people find things. Now, where is my phone!
