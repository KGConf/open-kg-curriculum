## Content
* Manchester Syntax is a user-friendly format for describing OWL ontologies. It helps simplify the structure of ontologies, making them easier to work with.
* In Knowledge Graphs, Manchester Syntax acts as a bridge between technical language (URIs and axioms) and natural language. It makes relationships between attributes clearer and more understandable.
* Its significance lies in providing a clearer grasp of ontology relationships, aiding in effective communication and comprehension.
* To apply it, you translate URIs and axioms into more intuitive language. For instance, "subclassOf" becomes "is a type of," enhancing the understanding of ontology relationships.
* Example : "Person subclassOf Human" is translated to "Person is a type of Human."
